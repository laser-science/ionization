# ionization
strong field ionization of atoms and molecules

ToftoEnergy is the c++ code used to take the time of flight data for ion fragments from the experiment and calculating the kinetic energy of the fragments.
The code can only run either the 'fast' peak or the 'slow' peak at one time, and which peak a particular .dat file represents must be known before running.
